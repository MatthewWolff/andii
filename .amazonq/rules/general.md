CRITICAL: Always verify your changes before proceeding

- After making changes, read back the files to confirm the changes are correct
- Build and test to ensure compilation succeeds
- Never assume sed commands or bulk changes worked correctly without verification

## Error Analysis

When build fails:

1. Focus on actual errors, ignore warnings
2. Fix errors one by one
3. Re-run build after each fix
